# Style Guide
*Style guide for out Rosette Idetification Project*

## Comment style
### Function comments
- All functions will have a block comment beofre the declartion of the function that specifies what the function does

### Inline comments
- Use inline comments to explain non-obvious logic in the code
- Place inline comments on its own line above the relavent code
    - Example: 
    ```
    # This is an inline comment!
    print("Hello world!")
    ```

## Naming conventions
Variable, function and class names should be clear and concise. A longer, more descriptive name is better than a short and unclear one.

**Variables and Functions**: `snake_case`

**Classes**: `CamelCase` (note class names should be capitalized)

**Constants and Global Variables**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## Coupling & Cohesion
We will follow [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles for this project
