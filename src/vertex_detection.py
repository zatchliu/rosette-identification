Vertex Detection Module

This module identifies ALL vertices in the image, points where 3 or more cells meet.
Uses the same algorithm as rosette detection but with a lower threshold.
These vertices represent the basic junctions between cells.

    Identify ALL vertices where multiple cells meet at a common point.
    
    This function samples points in the image and checks how many cell boundaries
